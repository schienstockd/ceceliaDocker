This is a `Dockerised` version of [`Cecelia`](https://github.com/schienstockd/cecelia).
We currently do not include `napari` in the container. That means, we have to install
a separate `conda` environment with which the `Docker container` can communicate.

**This package is pre-alpha**

Please follow the [`instructions on Read the Docs`](https://cecelia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docker_installation.html#docker-installation) to install the container.
